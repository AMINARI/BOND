# BOND
## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to define the system requirements for "BOND" that enables users to request and provide services in real-time. This platform facilitates connections based on shared skills or interests, allows transactions through modern payment methods or digital tokens, and provides tools for efficient management and customization of the work environment.

This SRS will serve as a foundation for the development, guiding the coding, architecture, and design of the system to ensure that it meets all business, functional, and non-functional requirements. It will also be used to break down tasks for development teams.

### 1.2 Scope
The platform will allow users to:
- Request and provide services (e.g., freelance work, hobby projects, skill-sharing).
- Connect via private, secure sessions.
- Reward service providers through traditional payments or blockchain-based digital tokens.
- Customize their user profiles, manage tasks, and track financials.
- Engage in social networking with others based on shared skills and interests.

The platform will be web-based and potentially mobile-optimized for accessibility across devices. It will be scalable to support a growing number of users and tasks over time.

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
- **Requester**: A user requesting a service or skill.
- **Provider**: A user offering a service or skill.
- **Session**: A private, real-time interaction between a requester and provider.

- **Digital Token**: A cryptographic asset used as an alternative reward for completed services.
- **Blockchain Integration**: The use of decentralized ledger technologies for digital token transactions.
- **API**: Application Programming Interface, used to integrate with external services (e.g., payment gateways, social media).
- **SRS**: System Requirements Specification.

### 1.4 References
- Payment API Documentation (e.g., Stripe, PayPal,baridimob)
- Digital token/blockchain platforms (e.g., Ethereum,sol,memecoin,)
- Security standards (e.g., OWASP, PCI DSS)

The platform will act as an independent web-based service but will integrate with external systems for payment processing, digital tokens, and social network APIs. The design will focus on modularity to ensure that the system can scale and adapt to evolving requirements.

### 2.2 Product Features
- **Service Requests**: Users can request services by specifying details like skill type, duration, and task description.
- **Real-Time Sessions**: Secure, private sessions between requesters and providers to complete services.
- **Payments and Digital Tokens**: Support for traditional payment methods and blockchain-based tokens as rewards.
- **Profile Customization**: Users can manage and customize their profiles, list skills, and track tasks.
- **Social Networking**: Users can connect based on shared interests, skills, and hobbies.
- **Task Management**: Tools for organizing, tracking, and managing requests and service deliverables.
- **Ratings & Reviews**: After completing a task, users can rate and review the service.

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
- **Requester**: A user who posts service requests, defines tasks, and approves or rejects completed work.
- **Provider**: A user offering services, participating in sessions, and completing tasks.
- **Administrator**: A user who manages the platform, handles user disputes, maintains data, and ensures compliance.
- **Viewer/Explorer**: A user who browses services, explores profiles, and connects based on interests.

### 2.4 Operating Environment
- **Web Platform**: Accessible via modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
- **Mobile App (optional)**: Android and iOS compatibility for on-the-go usage.
- **Server**: Cloud-based infrastructure with automatic scaling.

### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints
- The system must be designed for scalability to handle growth in users, transactions, and requests.
- Integration with external services (e.g., PayPal, Stripe for payments, Ethereum for tokens) must be seamless.
- Security must be prioritized to protect user data, payment information, and blockchain transactions.

## 3. Business Plan

### 3.1 Business Objective
The platformâ€™s objective is to provide a marketplace for skills, where users can request or offer services in a dynamic and rewarding environment. The system will generate revenue through:
- Transaction fees from payments for services.
- Premium memberships for enhanced profile visibility and features.
- Advertising or sponsored services for business users.

### 3.2 Market Research
The freelancing and gig economy market is growing rapidly. Competitors such as **Upwork**, **Fiverr**, and **TaskRabbit** offer freelance services but lack integration with digital currencies or focused community-building based on shared interests. This platform combines freelancing with social networking and innovative payment/reward models.

### 3.3 Monetization Model
- **Transaction Fees**: A commission on every completed transaction between requesters and providers.
- **Subscription Model**: Premium features, such as advanced analytics, featured profiles, and unlimited requests.
- **Advertising**: Businesses can promote their services or products targeted to users based on their interests.
